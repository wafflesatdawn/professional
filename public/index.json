[{"content":"Suppose that you started a new job and the first thing that awaited you was a vague request from the CEO: \u0026ldquo;I really want to know what people think about how to prepare sand dabs\u0026rdquo;. No further context is given because she is suddenly met by other people and has turned her focus to them, walking off. Your new manager is still around to say that the question is actually important, so you should try to produce an answer. How would you start?\nEstablishing context # Displays of whim and out-of-the-box thinking are not unheard of, and can be considered as tests or opportunities. The first thing to do is start asking a couple questions to establish context:\nWhat is the scope of the request? By \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo; was the CEO referring to the employees on site? Or at every site, if the company is a multinational? Or even broader, the entire country? Having selected a population from one of those options, how would their opinions be evaluated? Does everyone\u0026rsquo;s input have equal weight? What kind of sampling strategy should be used? In addition, there are also operational details:\nHow does the CEO want to receive status updates about the query\u0026ndash;impromptu chat (in-person or Teams/Slack), email, or meeting? What are the time constraints for delivering results? And how should results be presented? When in doubt, async is your out # Since it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to get immediate answers to these questions, the best alternative would be to adopt an asynchronous mindset, with the reasoning that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to sit around doing nothing until you get a response. So, take each of the questions above and write a memo that goes through them, listing potential options and which of them you\u0026rsquo;ll be working with.\nHow should you winnow these options? There are factors to consider, such as practicality, that will tilt the balance in favor of one over another. Scope is an easy example. Preparing to survey a large, globally distributed population would take no small effort, so starting with on-site only is reasonable, allowing for a pivot to the rest if needed. And speaking of surveys, they are ideal tools for collecting data\u0026ndash;especially in this case because of the subjectivity (what people think) and narrowness of topic (preparing sand dabs). There\u0026rsquo;s no reason to assume different weighting of inputs for this, but it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to always consider how the quality of your data varies across different sources. Choice of sampling strategy will depend heavily on the number of people on site. Ten employees is trivial, but a hundred or a thousand employees is another matter.\nThe importance of earnest sampling # Sampling properly is so important that it deserves special mention. Because it happens at the start of an experiment or project, before you start doing any fancy work, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to gloss it over. I might be biased but I like to give greater thought to the process that forms the entire basis of my datasets.\nIf the site had 100 employees, it might still be tempting to survey everyone and just call it a day because the total number seems small and you\u0026rsquo;ll get all the data you need. Or will you? A survey about making sand dab seems so trivial, being sent from a new employee no less, will it simply get ignored by the majority except for maybe a handful of people who are passionate about seafood? In this example, the CEO might not care that she\u0026rsquo;s only hearing from just a few people, but in real studies, this kind of response would be nonrepresentative and any conclusions drawn from it would be dubious.\nNow suppose the company was in the tech industry and had a large gender imbalance of 8:2 male-to-females. What are the assumptions and beliefs we hold about the culinary virtuousity of the typical man or woman? If we say that in the year 2023, they must be roughly equal by now, then we will be okay with sampling them as a homogenous group. However, if we believe their respective abilities and knowledge of cooking are skewed\u0026ndash;or even if we\u0026rsquo;re merely curious whether gender plays a role\u0026ndash;then we should use stratified sampling so our responses are labeled as coming from each group.\nIf using stratified sampling, then should each group have the same number of samples (disproportionate) or should it vary according to the group size (proportionate)? A proportionate sample here would be 8 men and 2 women (not mentioning non-binary for the sake of brevity). If you believe women know more about cooking than men, then the results you\u0026rsquo;ll be presenting to the CEO here would be uninspired or worse\u0026ndash;maybe lots of responses such as \u0026ldquo;microwave it and add hot sauce\u0026rdquo;. Proportionate samples reflect the population at the expense of groups. Conversely, a disproportionate sample here would be 5 of each gender, and the responses will be markedly different, maybe suggesting white wine or sous vide. Disproportionate samples amplify underrepresented groups.\nStatus # \u0026ldquo;Status update\u0026rdquo; is a phrase that can be colored several ways, depending on the circumstance. It could be just procedural and of little consequence: how UPS is working on your next delivery of Tide Pods. It could be bureaucratic and of much greater significance: the various stages of closing a real estate transaction. But it can also accrue a weight made heavy by negative emotions. Avoid this undesireable state by striving to make status updates more procedural or bureaucratic. Whether meeting, email, or chat, they should be proactive and regular.\nTime # In the absence of clear directives, we must make do with what we have, and here it boils down to common sense and educated guessing. Many units of measure exist for time. If you try to make a turnaround on the sand dabs within minutes or hours, will you have had enough time for it be of much substance? What about a day or several days? Weeks and months? The last two are obviously unlikely for this example, but weighing all the timeperiods as possible options produces a strong contrast that makes it obvious which are the most reasonable\u0026ndash;a day or several days. Depending on the work in question, there may be contending options for the most reasonable time estimate or constraint, but that\u0026rsquo;s not as much of an issue as long as they use different units of measures: days against weeks, weeks against months. Longer time horizons invite debate over strategic prioritization, which is more productive than quibbling over small degrees of precision.\nThe end # All said and done, I do not actually know any recipes for sand dabs. This contrivance came from a dream which I was able to remember as I woke up today, and since the memory was so fresh, it spurred me to jot down some thoughts, which morphed into a blog post. As for the dream itself, I can offer no explanation better than dream logic. I don\u0026rsquo;t even think I\u0026rsquo;ve had sand dabs more than once or twice, and it was from a little restaurant far off in Monterey. They had lightly floured and sauted it in butter, if I recall correctly.\n","date":"Jul 5, 2023","permalink":"/professional/posts/asking-about-sand-dabs/","section":"Posts","summary":"Suppose that you started a new job and the first thing that awaited you was a vague request from the CEO: \u0026ldquo;I really want to know what people think about how to prepare sand dabs\u0026rdquo;.","title":"Asking About Sand Dabs"},{"content":"","date":"Jul 5, 2023","permalink":"/professional/","section":"luminal transubstantiation","summary":"","title":"luminal transubstantiation"},{"content":"When you get your own OS-specific errors you have to start wondering whether the mere act of programming on Windows is a mistake.\nAn attempt has been made to start a new process before the\rcurrent process has finished its bootstrapping phase.\rThis probably means that you are not using fork to start your\rchild processes and you have forgotten to use the proper idiom\rin the main module:\rif __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;:\rfreeze_support()\r...\rThe \u0026#34;freeze_support()\u0026#34; line can be omitted if the program\ris not going to be frozen to produce an executable. This error snippet comes from Pytorch\u0026rsquo;s implementation of multiprocessing and can show up during execution even when your code doesn\u0026rsquo;t explicitly do any\u0026ndash;simply specifying a paramter such as num_workers is an implicit use of the feature and invites its caveats. The warning refers to the use of fork and starting subprocesses, but the choice of using it is not explicit either and simply is a consequence of what OS your machine is running.\nAccording to the PyTorch docs:\nSince workers rely on Python multiprocessing, worker launch behavior is different on Windows compared to Unix.\nOn Unix, fork() is the default multiprocessing start method. Using fork(), child workers typically can access the dataset and Python argument functions directly through the cloned address space. On Windows or MacOS, spawn() is the default multiprocessing start method. Using spawn(), another interpreter is launched which runs your main script, followed by the internal worker function that receives the dataset, collate_fn and other arguments through pickle serialization. Unix users won\u0026rsquo;t see this specific error because its implementation allows direct access to data and variables. Elsewhere, the spawn implementation causes independent processes to start up and when that happens, all the code will be run a second (or nth) time unless precautions are taken:\nThis separate serialization means that you should take two steps to ensure you are compatible with Windows while using multi-process data loading:\nWrap most of you main scriptâ€™s code within if name == \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo;: block, to make sure it doesnâ€™t run again (most likely generating error) when each worker process is launched. You can place your dataset and DataLoader instance creation logic here, as it doesnâ€™t need to be re-executed in workers. Make sure that any custom collate_fn, worker_init_fn or dataset code is declared as top level definitions, outside of the main check. This ensures that they are available in worker processes. (this is needed since functions are pickled as references only, not bytecode.) If the if __name__ == '__main__' guard idiom referenced seems novel, then your scripts have mostly been self-contained until now. Many if not all Python libraries make use of this to provide executable script functionality while still being importable as modules. The name variable is a Python default that\u0026rsquo;s automatically set to \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo; for the script that is directly executed. The idiom simply takes advantage of that fact to create a conditional, under which you place the separated code that\u0026rsquo;s intended to execute only when the script is run directly.\nIn the PyTorch example, code inside the guard won\u0026rsquo;t be run again as the multiprocessing workers launch, but it\u0026rsquo;s also correct to say that the same code won\u0026rsquo;t run upon being imported to another script. Anything outside the guard, such as a df or other global variable, will execute during import to other scripts.\n","date":"May 25, 2023","permalink":"/professional/posts/pytorch-multiprocessing/","section":"Posts","summary":"When you get your own OS-specific errors you have to start wondering whether the mere act of programming on Windows is a mistake.","title":"Multiprocessing errors in PyTorch"},{"content":"\rA recent Kaggle competition was launched that asks users to predict harvest yields from wild blueberries growing in the hills and mountains of the Northeast. As you might imagine, both the harvest and the subsequent harvest of data are not easy to come by. The dataset is actually generated from synthetic data which is itself based on a simulation of harvests that\u0026rsquo;s been refined for 30 years. Background details aside, the dataset will be a good example to use for tabular modeling, where the objective is to predict one column\u0026rsquo;s values based on values from the others. Tabular modeling includes decision trees and their evolved form, random forests, both of which will be focused on here using scikit-learn.\nAlthough tabular modeling is not as attention-grabbing as NLP and image recognition, it offers many strengths in its own right for structured data:\nfaster training ease of interpretation unbound by hardware constraints at scale (eg: tensor cores) less hyperparameter tuning That said, there are two exceptions to this: high cardinality in important categorical variables presence of data that would be handled much better by neural networks, such as columns containing plain text Unstructured data will always be the domain of deep learning, but for structured data the contest is less clear and it\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile to consider tabular modeling\u0026ndash;at the very least as a baseline.\nSetting up data # from pathlib import Path from pandas.api.types import is_string_dtype, is_numeric_dtype, is_categorical_dtype from fastai.tabular.all import * from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor, export_graphviz import dtreeviz from IPython.display import Image, display_svg, SVG import warnings import seaborn as sns # suppress the warning message from sklearn warnings.filterwarnings(action=\u0026#39;ignore\u0026#39;, category=UserWarning) data_path = Path(\u0026#39;./data\u0026#39;) df = pd.read_csv(data_path/\u0026#39;train.csv\u0026#39;, low_memory=False) As described by Kaggle, this dataset is very small\u0026ndash;barely over a megabyte\u0026ndash;and is intended to be a lighter complement to its intenser options.

The good news is that the problem can be mitigated by checking whether our model\u0026rsquo;s predictive power hinges on conditions that aren\u0026rsquo;t shared between the training and validation sets.\nTo achieve this we\u0026rsquo;ll simply create a new dependent variable that marks whether data is from the training set or the validation set and use a random forest to predict it.\ncombo = pd.concat([trn_xs, valid_xs]) is_valid = np.array([0]*len(trn_xs) + [1]*len(valid_xs)) m = rf(combo, is_valid) rf_feat_importance(m, combo)[:5] cols imp 5 id 0.210471 14 fruitset 0.179450 16 seeds 0.171691 15 fruitmass 0.169624 4 osmia 0.047923 We then look at the feature importance of the new model. For each feature, the higher the importance, the greater the disparity between validation and training datasets. In this case, there\u0026rsquo;s not much of a discrepancy betweeen validation and training data, with the highest importance at 0.2. This result reflects the random splitting of the original data, but if it were structured differently, such as a time series, then random splitting would not have been the ideal choice, leading to greater chance of bigger discrepancies.\nDeep learning version # Now let\u0026rsquo;s see what kind of MAE a neural network would produce.

That being said, since we expect the predictions from both models to be uncorrelated, it\u0026rsquo;s worth checking to see if an ensemble of both would generate a better prediction than either.

Though the recommended items are all different, all share the same origin of being generated by a process called \u0026lsquo;collaborative filtering\u0026rsquo;. The essence of it boils down to three steps: identify the things you used or liked, find other users who used or liked the same things, and suggest things that the other users used or liked. Notably, the process doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on user data entry or any manual assignment of categories for recommendations. Instead, what\u0026rsquo;s happens is the attribution of latent factors to users and items. These are numerical representations of the strength of the many and varied motivations behind user ratings and selections. Similarly, the recommendations have corresponding numbers that represent how well they fit those criteria.\nData setup # To make things less abstract let\u0026rsquo;s use an example based on a dataset of boardgames from BoardGameGeek that\u0026rsquo;s been uploaded to Kaggle.

Risk delivers fairly well on the theme of war, its playtime can be short as well as long, has low complexity in its rules, and is an old title. We could assign numbers between -1 and 1 to each of these like so:\nrisk = np.array([0.7,0.5,0.3,-0.6]) Similarly, a user might have a low interest in war games, be short on free time, prefers simplicity, and enjoys newer games. They could be assigned these numbers:\nuser1 = np.array([-.8,0.2,-0.5,0.6]) Collaborative filtering recommends items to users if the match between them is high, and it determines this by multiplying the arrays and adding up the result:\n(user1 * risk).sum() -0.97\rThe operation is referred to as a dot product and the arrays of numbers are the latent factors. In this case the -0.97 indicates a poor match. Someone with the opposite preferences would yield a higher number and thus be recommended Risk.\nThe latent factors in our example were arbitrarily selected (both the array lengths and array values), but in practice machine learning doesn\u0026rsquo;t start any differently\u0026ndash;the process initializes from random weights and refines them as the model learns.\nPreparing data # To start, we need to put the data into a dataloader, which is a fastai feature that helps with the creation of mini-batches for iteration during machine learning, and identify some constants: the number of users and games in the dataset. We arbitrarily pick 9 as the number of factors to train for.\nratings = users.merge(games) dls = CollabDataLoaders.from_df(ratings, item_name=\u0026#39;Name\u0026#39;, rating_name=\u0026#39;Rating\u0026#39;, user_name=\u0026#39;Username\u0026#39;) n_users = len(dls.classes[\u0026#39;Username\u0026#39;]) n_games = len(dls.classes[\u0026#39;Name\u0026#39;]) n_factors = 5 The next step is to create one-hot encodings: these are tensors that are mostly zeros except at one index, and they will represent categorical data about the boardgames, such as theme and year of release.

Making the loss function grow bigger is counterproductive in the short run, since it extends training time, but the tradeoff is worth it.\nBut how does simple addition prevent overfitting? Consider a plot of an overfitted loss function:\nimport seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt sns.relplot(games, x=\u0026#39;AvgRating\u0026#39;, y=\u0026#39;NumUserRatings\u0026#39;, alpha=.5) plt.plot([1, 10], [0, 77000], label=\u0026#39;under fit\u0026#39;, color=\u0026#39;navy\u0026#39;) plt.plot(range(1,11), [13, 300, 4000, 100, 8000, 2000, 51000, 110000, 700, 123], label=\u0026#39;over fit\u0026#39;, color=\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, scaley=\u0026#39;log\u0026#39;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026#34;upper left\u0026#34;) plt.show() When models are underfit, the loss function can take a wildly inaccurate and straight path. Overfit models, on the other hand, tend to zigzag as they try to adhere to data points. The scatterplot above is from some of the omitted columns in the boardgame dataset that\u0026rsquo;s been overlaid with cherry-picked numbers to illustrate, but this example also shows the zigzag pattern: Next, consider that quadratics such as \\( ax^2 + bx \\) get steeper and narrower as \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) grow larger. Weight decay leverages this effect so that the resulting trained weights (which want to go in the opposite direction of this line) do not overfit.\nWhat is forward and x? # The forward function allows pytorch to send arguments to other method calls.

(More on data types below.) \u0026gt; - You will probably see some random-looking values when printing your tensor. The torch.empty() call allocates memory for the tensor, but does not initialize it with any values - so what you\u0026rsquo;re seeing is whatever was in memory at the time of allocation.\nHowever, uncontrolled random tensor starting values are often less useful than all zeros or ones. If randomness is desired, it can be fixed to be the same every time using manual_seed:\nzeros = torch.zeros(2, 3) print(zeros) ones = torch.ones(2, 3) print(ones) torch.manual_seed(1729) random = torch.rand(2, 3) print(random) tensor([[0., 0., 0.],\r[0., 0., 0.]])\rtensor([[1., 1., 1.],\r[1., 1., 1.]])\rtensor([[0.3126, 0.3791, 0.3087],\r[0.0736, 0.4216, 0.0691]])\rComparison with numpy arrays # Tensors are higher dimensional analogues to numpy arrays, sharing many qualities such as their objectives, apis, syntax, and functionality.
