Suppose that you started a new job and the first thing that awaited you was a vague request from the CEO: "I really want to know what people think about how to prepare sand dabs". No further context is given because she is suddenly met by other people and has turned her focus to them, walking off. Your new manager is still around to say that the question is actually important, so you should try to produce an answer. How would you start?

## Establishing context
Displays of whim and out-of-the-box thinking are not unheard of, and can be considered as tests or opportunities. The first thing to do is start asking a couple questions to establish context:
- What is the scope of the request? By "people" was the CEO referring to the employees on site? Or at every site, if the company is a multinational? Or even broader, the entire country?
- Having selected a population from one of those options, how would their opinions be evaluated? Does everyone's input have equal weight? What kind of sampling strategy should be used?

In addition, there are also operational details:
- How does the CEO want to receive status updates about the query--impromptu chat (in-person or Teams/Slack), email, or meeting?
- What are the time constraints for delivering results? And how should results be presented?

## When in doubt, async is your out
Since it's not possible to get immediate answers to these questions, the best alternative would be to adopt an asynchronous mindset, with the reasoning that you don't want to sit around doing nothing until you get a response. So, take each of the questions above and write a memo that goes through them, listing potential options and which of them you'll be working with. 

How should you winnow these options? There are factors to consider, such as practicality, that will tilt the balance in favor of one over another. Scope is an easy example. Preparing to survey a large, globally distributed population would take no small effort, so starting with on-site only is reasonable, allowing for a pivot to the rest if needed. And speaking of surveys, they are ideal tools for collecting data--especially in this case because of the subjectivity (what people think) and narrowness of topic (preparing sand dabs). There's no reason to assume different weighting of inputs for this, but it's a good idea to always consider how the quality of your data varies across different sources. Choice of sampling strategy will depend heavily on the number of people on site. Ten employees is trivial, but a hundred or a thousand employees is another matter.

## The importance of earnest sampling
Sampling properly is so important that it deserves special mention. Because it happens at the start of an experiment or project, before you start doing any fancy work, it's easy to gloss it over. I might be biased but I like to give greater thought to the process that forms the entire basis of my datasets.

If the site had 100 employees, it might still be tempting to survey everyone and just call it a day because the total number seems small and you'll get all the data you need. Or will you? A survey about making sand dab seems so trivial, being sent from a new employee no less, will it simply get ignored by the majority except for maybe a handful of people who are passionate about seafood? In this example, the CEO might not care that she's only hearing from just a few people, but in real studies, this kind of response would be nonrepresentative and any conclusions drawn from it would be dubious.

Now suppose the company was in the tech industry and had a large gender imbalance of 8:2 male-to-females. What are the assumptions and beliefs we hold about the culinary virtuousity of the typical man or woman? If we say that in the year 2023, they must be roughly equal by now, then we will be okay with sampling them as a homogenous group. However, if we believe their respective abilities and knowledge of cooking are skewed--or even if we're merely curious whether gender plays a role--then we should use stratified sampling so our responses are labeled as coming from each group.

If using stratified sampling, then should each group have the same number of samples (disproportionate) or should it vary according to the group size (proportionate)? A proportionate sample here would be 8 men and 2 women (not mentioning non-binary for the sake of brevity). If you believe women know more about cooking than men, then the results you'll be presenting to the CEO here would be uninspired or worse--maybe lots of responses such as "microwave it and add hot sauce". Proportionate samples reflect the population at the expense of groups. Conversely, a disproportionate sample here would be 5 of each gender, and the responses will be markedly different, maybe suggesting white wine or sous vide. Disproportionate samples amplify underrepresented groups.

## Status
"Status update" is a phrase that can be colored several ways, depending on the circumstance. It could be just procedural and of little consequence: how UPS is working on your next delivery of Tide Pods. It could be bureaucratic and of much greater significance: the various stages of closing a real estate transaction. But it can also accrue a weight made heavy by negative emotions. Avoid this undesireable state by striving to make status updates more procedural or bureaucratic. Whether meeting, email, or chat, they should be proactive and regular.

## Time
In the absence of clear directives, we must make do with what we have, and here it boils down to common sense and educated guessing. Many units of measure exist for time. If you try to make a turnaround on the sand dabs within minutes or hours, will you have had enough time for it be of much substance? What about a day or several days? Weeks and months? The last two are obviously unlikely for this example, but weighing all the timeperiods as possible options produces a strong contrast that makes it obvious which are the most reasonable--a day or several days. Depending on the work in question, there may be contending options for the most reasonable time estimate or constraint, but that's not as much of an issue as long as they use different units of measures: days against weeks, weeks against months. Longer time horizons invite debate over strategic prioritization, which is more productive than quibbling over small degrees of precision.

## The end
All said and done, I do not actually know any recipes for sand dabs. This contrivance came from a dream which I was able to remember as I woke up today, and since the memory was so fresh, it spurred me to jot down some thoughts, which morphed into a blog post. As for the dream itself, I can offer no explanation better than dream logic. I don't even think I've had sand dabs more than once or twice, and it was from a little restaurant far off in Monterey. They had lightly floured and sauted it in butter, if I recall correctly.
