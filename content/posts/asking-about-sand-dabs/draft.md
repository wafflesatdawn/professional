Suppose that you started a new job and the first thing that awaited you was a vague request from the CEO: "I really want to know what people think about how to prepare sand dabs". No further context is given because she is suddenly met by other people and has turned her focus to them, walking off. Your new manager is still around to say that the question is actually important, so you should try to produce an answer. How would you start?

## Establishing context
Displays of whim and out-of-the-box thinking are not unheard of, and can be considered as tests or opportunities. The first thing to do is start asking a couple questions to establish context:
- What is the scope of the request? By "people" was the CEO referring to the employees on site? Or at every site, if the company is a multinational? Or even broader, the entire country?
- Having selected a population from one of those options, how would their opinions be evaluated? Does everyone's input have equal weight? What kind of sampling strategy should be used?

In addition, there are also operational details:
- How does the CEO want to receive status updates about the query--impromptu chat (in-person or Teams/Slack), email, or meeting?
- What are the time constraints for delivering results? And how should results be presented?

## When in doubt, async is your out
Since it's not possible to get immediate answers to these questions, the best alternative would be to adopt an asynchronous mindset, with the reasoning that you don't want to sit around doing nothing until you get a response. So, take each of the questions above and write a memo that goes through them, listing potential options and which of them you'll be working with. 

How should you winnow these options? There are factors to consider, such as practicality, that will tilt the balance in favor of one over another. Scope is an easy example. Preparing to survey a large, globally distributed population would take no small effort, so we go with on-site only and pivot to expand the scope later if needed. And speaking of surveys, they are ideal tools for collecting data--especially in this case because of the subjectivity (what people think) and narrowness of topic (preparing sand dabs). There's no reason to assume different weighting of inputs for this, but it's a good idea to always consider the quality of your data coming from different sources. Choice of sampling strategy will depend heavily on the number of people on site. Ten employees is trivial, but a hundred or a thousand employees is another matter.

### The importance of earnest sampling
Sampling properly is so important that it deserves special mention. Because it happens at the start of an experiment, before you start doing any fancy work, it's easy to gloss it over--just use the sampling method you always use, or develop some quick n' easy heuristics to go by. I might be biased but I like to give greater thought to the process that forms the entire basis of my datasets.

With 100 employees, it might be tempting
